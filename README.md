# FrozenLakeGameQLearningAI
An AI based on Q learning from Reinforcement Learning. The Agent (game player) performs a certain set of actions in an Environment. The agent takes an action (Moves up, down, left, and right). The environment then samples a reward (points recieved by the player for moving in a specific direction) and next state (described location of the player on the grid). The player then receives the award and proceeds to the next state sampled by the environment. This process repeats itself until the player reaches a terminal state.
